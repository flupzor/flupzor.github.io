    <h1>Abbott Freestyle</h1>
    <b> Note: i figured out what the checksum is. See below. </b>
    <p> This is a description of the protocol which is used by the following
    devices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Abbott Freestyle FREEDOM-Lite</li>
      <li>Abbott Freestyle mini</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a work in progress. There are some parts which aren't clear to me yet. </p>

    <p>These devices use a TRS (mini-jack) RS232 to either USB or Serial cable.</p>

    <p>I use the Texas Instruments 3410 USB serial adapter from Abbott for
    testing.</p>

    <p>The protocol description is done in ABNF, this standard can be found <a
	    href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/std/std68.txt">here</a>.</p>

    <p>You might notice there are some quirks in the protocol. So it likely isn't
    a mistake if two spaces are used for no reason or if a newline is used for
    no reason.</p>

    <h2>Protocol</h2>
    The FreeStyle protocol has 2 types of messages a command and a result.
    Currently only one command exists which returns multiple results.
    <pre>
    generic-message = command / result
    </pre>

    <p>The host starts with setting up the connection. After that it should
    send the following command:</p>

    <pre>
    command = "mem"
    </pre>

    <p>The device then sends the following data. </p>

    <pre>
    result = devicetype softwarerevision currentdatetime log
    log = ("Log Empty" end1 | (nrresults resultlines) end2)
    resultlines = firstresult *otherresults 
    </pre>
    <b>Device type</b>
    There are ofcourse more devices then this. However, i don't know which.
    Please send me more device types!
    <pre>
    devicetype = CR LF ( "DAMH359-63524" \ ; FreeStyle Mini
			 "CDMK311-B0764" \ ; FreeStyle Freedom Lite
			 "DBMN169-C4824" ) ; FreeStyle Lite

    </pre>

    <b>Software revision</b>
    The software revision doesn't seem to be very consistent. The first number
    has 5 spaces between the number and "-P" while the second one does not.  As
    you see both of the devices i own have a integer part a radix point and a
    fractional part and it ends with "-P". I have no idea what this means other
    that it is a software revision.

    There are ofcourse more software revisions then this. However, i don't know which.
    Please send me more software revisions!
    
    <pre>
    softwarerevision = CR LF ( "4.0100     -P" \ ; On my FreeStyle Mini
			       "0.31-P" \ ; On my FreeStyle Freedom Lite (The missing spaces isn't a mistake)
			       "1.43       -P" ) ; On my FreeStyle Lite
    </pre>

    <b>Current time and date</b>
    <pre>
    currentdatetime = CR LF datetime

    datetime = month SP day SP year SP time
    month = "Jan " / "Feb " / "Mar " / "Apr " / "May " / "June" / "July" /
	    "Aug " / "Sep " / "Oct " / "Nov " / "Dec " ; N.B. Except June and July all months have spaces at the end.
    day = 2DIGIT
    year = 4DIGIT

    time = hour ':' minute ':' second
    hour = 2DIGIT
    minute = 2DIGIT
    second = 2DIGIT
    </pre>

    <b>Number of results</b>
    <p>There is probably is a maximum to this. At the moment I am guessing it
    is 450 which is the maximum the Abbott Precision Xceed can store. The
    minimum is 1</p>

    <pre>
    nrresults = CR LF 3DIGIT; e.g. 001 or 250
    </pre>
    <pre>e.g.:  CR LF "250"</pre>

    <b>Result line</b>

    The first result has: CR LF LF for some reason. The others result lines
    don't.

    <pre>
    firstresult = CR LF LF resultline
    otherresults = CR LF resultline
    resultline = sugarlevel datetime2 plasmatype "0x00"
    sugarlevel = 3DIGIT ; e.g. 300 (I don't know what the maximum or minimum is)
    datetime2 = month SP day sp year sp time2
    time2 = hour ':' minute
    plasmatype = 2DIGIT
    </pre>

    <b>End</b>

    <pre>
    end1 = "END"
    end2 = "0x" 4DIGIT end1 ; The 4DIGIT part is a checksum. It is the
    accumulation of all the ASCII characters (excluding the 0x000 END part).
    </pre>
