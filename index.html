    <p>I've been trying to figure out the protocol for the Abbott Freestyle
    product line. I made a protocol description which can be found <a
    href="protocol.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for the description for the Abbott Xceed product line,
    Chris Ridd made an awesome description which can be found <a
    href="http://www.lnv.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/xceed/">here</a>. He also made an
    implementation in Objective C, but I haven't found time to test that.</p>

    <p>Abbott sells an adapter cable which uses the TI 3410 chipset. This
    chipset is supported by most modern operating systems, however not all
    include the Abbott vendor id/product id (0x1a61, 0x3410 respectively).
    Currently it should work by default in Windows XP using the driver Abbott
    supplied, and in OpenBSD since
    <a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=129261992926939&w=2">this</a>
    commit. Getting it working with other operating systems should be
    trivial.</p>
