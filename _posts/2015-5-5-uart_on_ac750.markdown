Having root is fun, talking to the UART is better.

Opening up the device was quite a hassle, there are two screws and the rest is
fastened using plastic clips. I had to break a couple of clips when I opened
the device.  I honestly don't see how you can open the device without breaking
these clips.

There are 4 solder pointers on the board with a label "J2", I guessed this was
where you can connect the UART. And it turns out I was right. I soldered a 4-pin
header on the board to make it easier to connect a serial cable.

I first tried this with an Adafruit 4 Pin Cable (PL2303). But sadly, I blew it
up connecting it to the 3.3v pin (or, at least, I think that is wat caused it.)

After which I tried, what I believe originally was a Nokia phone connector
cable which can be (ab)used as a 3.3v serial cable. And yay! It worked.

This is the pin-out on the board. Pin 1 is the pin with the white dash above
it.

J2

| Pin | Function |
| --- | -------- |
| 1   |  Probably 3.3v. |
| 2   |  Ground (Connected to ground) |
| 3   |  TX (Connected to RX) |
| 4   |  RX (Connected to TX) |

The Nokia phone connector

| Cable | Function |
| ----- | -------- |
| Black | Ground   |
| White | RX       |
| Blue  | TX       |

The baudrate is: 115200

You can find a dump of the successful UART connection [here][uart-dump]. Note
that I entered the password wrong twice.
